# Push Notification Testing Guide

## üß™ **Testing Push Notifications**

### **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Development build** - Limited push notifications (background only)
- ‚ùå **EAS build** - Network upload issues (will fix later)
- ‚úÖ **Notification system** - Fully implemented and ready

### **What Works in Development Build:**
1. **App in background** - Push notifications work
2. **App in foreground** - Local notifications work (smart filtering)
3. **Notification test button** - Test notifications work

### **What Doesn't Work in Development Build:**
1. **App completely closed** - No push notifications (Expo limitation)

## üß™ **Test Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Local Notifications**
1. Open the app
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Tap "Test Notification" button
4. Should see notification in 2 seconds

### **Step 2: Test Background Notifications**
1. Put app in background (don't close completely)
2. Send message from web app
3. Should receive push notification

### **Step 3: Test Smart Filtering**
1. Open chat in app
2. Send message from web app
3. Should NOT receive notification (smart filtering)

## üîß **EAS Build Issues:**

### **Problem:**
- Network connection fails during upload to EAS
- "Client network socket disconnected before secure TLS connection established"

### **Solutions to Try:**
1. **Different network** - Try mobile hotspot
2. **VPN** - Some networks block Google Cloud Storage
3. **Retry later** - EAS servers might be having issues
4. **Local build** - Use `expo run:android` for local build

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

1. **Test current implementation** - Verify notifications work in background
2. **Fix EAS build** - Resolve network issues
3. **Test closed app** - EAS build will enable this

## üì± **Expected Results:**

- **‚úÖ Test button** - Should work immediately
- **‚úÖ Background notifications** - Should work when app is in background
- **‚úÖ Smart filtering** - Should not notify when in chat
- **‚ùå Closed app** - Won't work until EAS build is fixed
